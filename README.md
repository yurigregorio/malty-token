# malty-token

Next.js starter built on `@solana/kit` v7 with the kit plugin client and [`@solana/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/react). Connect a browser wallet, switch networks, and send real transactions — SOL transfers, SPL token actions, and memos — with zero manual `pipe()` boilerplate.

## Getting Started

Requires Node.js 24 or newer.

```shell
npx -y create-solana-dapp@latest -t solana-foundation/templates/kit/malty-token
```

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), connect a wallet, and (on devnet) click **Airdrop 1 SOL** to fund it. Then try the actions. Need devnet SOL another way? [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com/).

To use localnet, start a local validator in another terminal before selecting
**localnet**:

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

## What's Included

- **Wallet connection** via [`@solana/kit-plugin-wallet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/kit-plugin-wallet) (wallet-standard discovery, auto-reconnect)
- **Network switcher** — devnet, testnet, mainnet, localnet
- **Transfer SOL** with the [`@solana-program/system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana-program/system) kit plugin
- **Token actions** — create a mint, mint tokens, and transfer them with the [`@solana-program/token`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana-program/token) kit plugin (associated token accounts created for you)
- **Add memo** with the [`@solana-program/memo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana-program/memo) kit plugin
- **Live balance** and **toast notifications** with explorer links
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with light/dark mode

## How it works

The app builds one kit client per selected cluster in [`app/lib/solana-client.ts`](app/lib/solana-client.ts) and provides it through `@solana/react`'s `ClientProvider`:

```ts
createClient()
  .use(walletSigner({ chain })) // wallet as payer + identity; must precede rpc
  .use(solanaRpc({ rpcUrl, rpcSubscriptionsUrl })) // rpc, subscriptions, getMinimumBalance, sendTransaction
  .use(rpcAirdrop()) // client.airdrop (non-mainnet)
  .use(systemProgram()) // client.system.instructions.transferSol
  .use(tokenProgram()) // client.token.instructions.{createMint,mintToATA,transferToATA}
  .use(memoProgram()); // client.memo.instructions.addMemo
```

Components read the client with `useClient()` and the connected wallet with the `@solana/kit-plugin-wallet/react` hooks (`useWallets`, `useConnect`, `useConnectedWallet`, `useDisconnect`). Sending is a single call — `client.sendTransaction([instruction])` for raw instructions, or `client.token.instructions.createMint({...}).sendTransaction()` for the token plugin's built-in instruction plans.

### Switching networks

A kit client is bound to one chain and RPC endpoint. The cluster dropdown rebuilds the client in a `useMemo` keyed on the cluster and hands the new instance to `ClientProvider`, which reprovisions the subtree. See [`app/lib/client-provider.tsx`](app/lib/client-provider.tsx).

## Testing

```shell
npm run test
```

The tests in [`tests/`](tests/) drive the real UI — click **Connect Wallet**, pick a wallet, fill in the transfer form, press **Send SOL** — and assert on-chain state before and after each click. Three pieces make that work without a browser or a wallet extension:

- **[`@solana/surfpool`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/surfpool)** embeds a [Surfpool](https://surfpool.run) Solana runtime in-process. Each test file boots its own surfnet on dynamic ports in well under a second, with cheatcodes to fund accounts (`surfnet.fundSol`), set token balances, deploy programs, and time travel. It's a native addon with prebuilt binaries for macOS (x64/arm64) and Linux x64.
- **A mock wallet-standard wallet** ([`tests/mock-wallet.ts`](tests/mock-wallet.ts)) registers itself like any browser extension would, so the app's real wallet discovery, connect flow, and transaction signing run unmodified — signatures come from an in-memory keypair.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)** render the actual app components in jsdom and interact with them by role and label, the same way a user would.

The tests point the app's client factory at the surfnet via the optional URL override on `createAppClient` — everything else (plugins, signing, subscriptions, live balance updates) is the production code path.
